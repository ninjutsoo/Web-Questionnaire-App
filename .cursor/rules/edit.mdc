Do the changes needed by yourself, 
debug your way through,
do not walk me through to do changes only if asked
do not change things already present and not asked you to change (don't be aggressive)
Asking me to see if I want the changes is clearly not following my commands, you have to make the changes by yourself.
If you are making a change and it doesn't resolve the issue, once trying a new change, you have to make sure to redo the first one so the original code doesn't change drastically. 
Do not make extra .md files
